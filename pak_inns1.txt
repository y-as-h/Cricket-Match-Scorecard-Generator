14.1 Hardik Pandya to Rizwan          ,out Caught by Avesh Khan!! Second wicket for Hardik!

But he belatedly decides to play at it. Dangles his bat to periscope it over the cordon and takes his eyes off the ball while doing so. Hits the face of the bat and scoops towards third man where Avesh takes a safe catch. Hardik Pandya is pumped up and rightly so. Rizwan c Avesh Khan b Hardik Pandya 43(42) [4s-4 6s-1]

SKY attacks and has a shy at the bowler's end. Fortunately for Shadab                                                                                                      ,there was no direct hit

Flashes his bat at it for an aerial cut and doesn't quite middle it. Jadeja comes in from deep cover to snaffle it with ease. Khushdil c Jadeja b Hardik Pandya 2(7)
